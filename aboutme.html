          <h1>Hi, I'm Mariann, <br />a UX/UI Designer<span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span></h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            I spent most of my life in the beautiful capital city of Estonia, where I lived for
            nearly 20 years. When I decided to move to Germany to study tourism management, my plans
            were unexpectedly derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this challenge led me to
            discover my passion for UX/UI design, which I realized was the perfect career path for
            me. Now, I find myself in the Netherlands, where I am majoring in user experience design
            and working to build my future in this exciting field. <br /><br />In my free time, I
            enjoy exploring new hobbies like knitting socks, embroidery, baking, and playing on my
            Switch. I also like to unwind by cozying up with a good movie. I'm always looking for
            new challenges, whether it's running 16km in the mud or trying my hand at waterskiing.
            <br /><br />What I love most about UX design is prototyping, as I find it an immersive
            experience that I can get lost in for hours. My studies in Communication & Multimedia
            Design have deepened my interest in UX/UI and web design. During my internship at
            Orbital Eye, I had the opportunity to improve my skills and learn more about satellite
            monitoring. This experience furthered my already existing interest in space and taught
            me so much more about the field.

            As part of the Shared Spaces course, our team was given the exciting opportunity to work
            as service designers for NS. Our task was to improve the bike parking experience in
            medium and small-sized train stations across the Netherlands. After much research and
            brainstorming, we developed an innovative concept that eliminates the need for bulky
            lockers and enhances the bike parking experience by incorporating elements of
            storytelling and nature. More information about our project will be available in my
            portfolio soon.

            As a UX/UI Designer at Orbital Eye, I played a critical role in improving the usability
            of the CoSMiC-EYE application, which enables customers to analyze and classify data
            generated by satellite data analysis. Specifically, I focused on refining the app's
            design and workflow to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. My contributions
            included creating wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity designs using tools such as
            Figma and Protopie. By collaborating closely with the development team and conducting
            user testing, I ensured that the app met the needs of its users, resulting in a more
            engaging and streamlined experience.

            As part of my Research & Design course at university, I undertook a project that
            involved independently working on the CrisisSuite application from Merlin Software.
            Specifically, I focused on improving the user experience during the warm phase of a
            crisis situation. Through my design process, I developed a high-fidelity prototype of
            the Logtool feature that aimed to streamline data entry and improve the accessibility of
            important information. The project honed my skills in user-centered design, rapid
            prototyping, and usability testing.
