          <h1>Hi, I'm Mariann, <br />a UX Designer<span class="wave">👋</span></h1>
          <br />
          <p>
           I'm an Estonian living in the Netherlands, and I recently graduated with distinction in UX Design. 🎓
            What excites me most about UX design is the power to create meaningful experiences that truly impact customers. At Merlin and Orbital Eye, I’ve had the privilege of contributing to companies that prioritize making a difference—not only for their customers but also for the wider world. Whether it’s through research, analysis, or crafting seamless wireframes, I’m driven by the desire to design solutions that solve real problems.<br> <br>I’m particularly passionate about research and analysis. I love diving deep into the details, figuring out what works (and what doesn’t), and turning insights into actionable solutions. My favorite research methods include expert reviews and accessibility audits, which allow me to ensure designs are inclusive and functional for all.

         When I’m not working, I enjoy exploring new hobbies like reading 📖, baking 🧁, and playing volleyball 🏐. I also love challenging myself—whether it’s running a 20km obstacle course or trying out waterskiing. 🧭 I’m always on the lookout for opportunities that allow me to grow, both personally and professionally.
