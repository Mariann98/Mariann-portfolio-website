        <p><i>User Experience/Interface Design</i></p>
        <p>As part of the Research & Design course, I had the opportunity to work with Merlin Software B.V, which provides practical software tools for crisis management. My task was to improve the CrisisSuite software during the warm phase, and I focused on enhancing the Logtool - the most critical tool used during a crisis. My goal was to streamline the user experience and ensure that all necessary information could be easily registered and accessed in a timely manner.

        <h3>CoSMiC-EYE</h3>
        <p><i>User Experience/Interface Design</i></p>
        <p>During my internship, my primary focus was redesigning the CoSMiC-EYE application, a satellite-based tool for monitoring critical infrastructure near pipelines. Users, including data analysts and clients, use this application to compare satellite images and detect changes near pipelines. As a UX/UI designer, I conducted extensive research, created high-fidelity prototypes, and followed a five-phase design process: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. This involved understanding user needs, adding features, removing unnecessary elements, and crafting a new interface to improve usability and functionality.        </p>

        <h3>Eurail accessibility redesign</h3>
        <p><i>Accessibility Improvement</i></p>
        <p>While planning my trip to the Christmas markets in Germany, I encountered a few usability and accessibility issues on the Eurail website. I decided to conduct an initial expert review and an accessibility audit to identify the most basic problems. My focus was on fixing the fundamental design elements and ensuring the website met WCAG AA accessibility standards. This was a hobby project where I primarily aimed to improve the overall user experience without going into deeper levels of redesign. The two pages I worked on were the "Seat reservation" and "Train schedule" pages.

        <h3>Revamping the NS bike lockers </h3>
        <p><i>Service Design</i></p>
        <p>NS, the Dutch railway company, approached my team of 3 for a solution to create better bicycle parking at smaller stations. They wanted an innovative, user-friendly design that solves space issues and safety concerns. This design needed to be easily installable at any small Dutch station, adaptable to various bike types, and provide guaranteed, secure parking. Our focus was on the entire user journey, including bike and train travel, and exploring additional NS services. Ultimately, our goal was an affordable, sustainable solution that ensures commuter satisfaction and bicycle safety.

<div id="about-me"class="about-me">
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I'm an Estonian living in the Netherlands, and a proud graduate in UX Design (with distinction, no less! 🎓) What excites me most about UX design is the power to create meaningful experiences that truly impact customers. At Merlin and Orbital Eye, I’ve had the privilege of contributing to companies that prioritize making a difference—not only for their customers but also for the wider world. Whether it’s through research, analysis, or crafting seamless wireframes, I’m driven by the desire to design solutions that solve real problems.
    <br><br>
    I’m particularly passionate about research and analysis. I love diving deep into the details, figuring out what works (and what doesn’t), and turning insights into actionable solutions. My favorite research methods include expert reviews and accessibility audits, which allow me to ensure designs are inclusive and functional for all.  
    <br><br>
    When I’m not working, I enjoy exploring new hobbies like reading 📖, baking 🧁, and playing volleyball 🏐. I also love challenging myself—whether it’s running a 20km obstacle course or trying out waterskiing. 🧭 I’m always on the lookout for opportunities that allow me to grow, both personally and professionally.
