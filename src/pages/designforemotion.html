              The project focused on the role of emotion in creating engaging user experiences.
              Through creative research and design explorations, my team of four developed a
              strategy for eliciting anxiety through design to ultimately benefit the user in the
              long term.
              <br />Our solution was the Alarmio app, designed to help people who struggle with
              discipline and waking up early. The app uses a punishment system to motivate users to
              wake up quickly and consistently. By eliciting anxiety, we create a sense of urgency
              that helps users build better habits over time.

          <h4 class="prso">Problem: Addressing the impact of emotions in design</h4>
          <p>
            The task was to understand how feelings impact the user experience. By doing research
            and exploring design ideas, we wanted to figure out how emotions are important in making
            a meaningful connection between users and interactive products. After understanding
            this, our goal was to use what we learned to create a design that includes emotions in a
            practical and effective way to make the user experience better.

          <h4 class="prso">Solution: Alarm.io</h4>
          <p>
            The final solution, Alarm.io, is an alarm clock app employing emotional design to help
            users wake up on time. Users sign up, connect with Instagram, and select 5 photos for
            the app to modify. They also connect their electric toothbrush via Bluetooth. The app
            uses a triggering sound to prompt users to start brushing their teeth when the alarm
            goes off. Failure to comply results in a threat to post a modified photo on Instagram.
            The app utilizes gamification and social media pressure to motivate users to establish a
            consistent morning routine and form healthy habits.

            <h4>Emotional Situation</h4>
            <p>
              To determine our emotional situation, we began by brainstorming different experiences
              that have made us feel very emotional. After generating a list, we grouped together
              similar situations and removed those that were not relevant to everyone. We then used
              a dot voting technique to refine our selection, repeating the process twice to arrive
              at our final decision. Through this process of convergence, we arrived at "unexpected
              public performance" as our chosen emotional situation.

            <h4>Emotional explorations</h4>
            <p>
              Our team embarked on an exploration of emotions, utilizing three unique methods:
              Mapping, Soundscape, and Box. Each of these explorations had a clear intention, which
              we followed through on by executing a detailed plan. Through this process, we were
              able to generate valuable findings and insights that allowed us to reflect on our
              emotional experiences. By carefully analyzing and synthesizing our results, we gained
              a deeper understanding of the complex ways in which emotions can impact our lives.

            <h6>The Mapping</h6>
            <p>
              'The Mapping' began as an emotional exploration aimed at delving deeper into the
              experience of unexpected public speaking. We sought to gain a comprehensive
              understanding of the emotions that arise before, during, and after a performance.
              Through this process, we also aimed to familiarize ourselves with the concept of
              emotional granularity by closely analyzing our thoughts, feelings, actions, and bodily
              responses during each stage of the experience. I have visually represented my own
              experience in the graph below.

              Our team analyzed the emotional mapping of unexpected public speaking and identified a
              specific area of interest: the 'during the performance' stage. We found significant
              differences in emotions during this phase and agreed that exploring the contrasts
              would be fascinating. Therefore, we will be focusing on this aspect of the soundscape
              for further investigation.

              Our latest emotional exploration, 'The Box', aimed to examine how individuals react in
              different surroundings. The experiment was conducted in two parts to showcase the
              impact that the environment can have on a person's state of mind. To facilitate this,
              we constructed an empty black box that elicited feelings of stage fright, despite
              there being no audience present. The first part of the experiment was designed to
              evoke feelings of exposure and anxiety, while the second part aimed to create a sense
              of confidence and preparedness. Through this exploration, we hope to shed light on the
              profound influence of surroundings on our emotions and behavior.

            <h4>Exploration Insights & Design Principles before</h4>
            <p>
              After conducting our explorations, we identified key insights and developed design
              principles for our emotional installation.
            </p>
            <h6>Insights</h6>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Speaking on stage in front of an audience can cause physical reactions like
                trembling and sweating, which can lead to insecurity and loss of concentration.
              </li>
              <li>
                The size of the stage can affect anxiety levels, as empty space can make the speaker
                feel exposed and vulnerable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Positive feedback from the audience can help boost confidence and self-esteem.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h6>Principles</h6>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Discomfort is more likely to occur when the speaker is positioned in the center of a
                large, empty space.
              </li>
              <li>
                Anxiety can be increased by using minimal lighting and directing it solely at the
                user.
              </li>
              <li>
                Focusing on physical reactions (such as trembling, sweating) can intensify them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Positive feedback should be incorporated to make the experience feel more rewarding.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cheerful sounds can enhance self-confidence and create a sense of recognition.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Emotional Installation</h4>
            <p>
              Our emotional installation aimed to observe how people would react to the same
              situation under different circumstances. Each visitor stood on a chair that resembled
              a stage, with headphones on, bright light shining towards them, and watched the same
              video projected on the wall. To add to the experience, their hands were sprayed with
              water to simulate sweat. The installation began and ended the same way, with a racing
              heart at the start and a round of applause at the end from an imaginary audience.
              However, half of the visitors listened to an upbeat song with enthusiastic cheers,
              while the other half continued to listen to a pulsing heartbeat paired with an anxious
              melody.

            <p>
              After conducting our emotional installation, we identified key insights and created
              design principles to guide our iterations.
            </p>
            <h6>Insights</h6>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Fear, horror, and depression can cause a subjective perception of time to lengthen,
                while joy and carelessness have little effect on time perception.
              </li>
              <li>Sound can manipulate our focus and interpretation of visuals.</li>
              <li>
                Receiving praise after a poor performance can confuse and make individuals feel
                undeserving of recognition.
              </li>
              <li>Listening to a positive soundscape can increase physical activity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h6>Principles</h6>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Elevated surfaces, such as chairs, can trigger feelings of insecurity and stress.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tense soundscapes can evoke feelings of insecurity and negatively influence
                perception.
              </li>
              <li>Negative perceptions are more likely to arise from tense soundscapes.</li>
              <li>
                Dark and heavy musical accompaniment can influence the interpretation of events as
                negative.
              </li>
              <li>Positive sounds can increase energy levels in the body.</li>

            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p>
              In our ideation session, we posed the question, 'How can we use anxiety to trigger
              something good?' Each team member individually brain-dumped their thoughts on this
              topic, which we then voted on and offered suggestions for improvement. From there, we
              collaborated to cluster our favorite ideas and had a group discussion to explain our
              preferences and the reasons behind them. Mixing guilt and anxiety, we chose the idea
              that resonated most with the latter. To further develop the concept, we used HMW
              questions to clarify our objectives, and after three rounds of voting, we determined
              key features to implement in our iteration. It was a productive process that
              ultimately led us to a promising solution.

            <h4>Iteration 1 and 2</h4>
            <h6>First iteration</h6>
            <p>
              During our iteration, we decided to test two punishment systems for the alarm clock:
              charging money and auto-sending random photos from the user’s gallery to random
              contacts when the user snoozes or ignores the alarm. Our goal is to learn what users
              think and feel about these features, and determine which one causes more anxiety to
              focus on in our design.
            </p>
            <h6>Execution</h6>
            <p>
              To execute this test, each team member implemented one of the two ideas on one or two
              people. Our target group was individuals with discipline problems who struggle to wake
              up in the morning, and who own an electric toothbrush.
              <br />For the first idea, we called the user in the early morning and asked them to
              take a picture of themselves brushing their teeth. If the user fails to send the
              picture within 5 minutes, they will be charged 5 euros as punishment. After testing,
              we interviewed the user to gather feedback on their experience. <br /><br />The second
              idea involves threatening to upload a compromising picture of the user if they snooze
              the alarm. Similar to the first idea, if the user does not send a picture within 5
              minutes, we will post an embarrassing picture of them on Instagram. By conducting
              these tests and gathering user feedback, we hoped to determine which punishment system
              is more effective and refine our design accordingly.

            <h6>Second iteration</h6>
            <p>
              For our second iteration, we wanted to improve the photo punishment feature of
              Alarm.io to make it less intimidating while still motivating users to wake up. After
              brainstorming, we came up with a solution - photoshopped embarrassing pictures of the
              user posted online if they snooze their alarm.
            </p>
            <h6>Execution</h6>
            <p>
              To test this idea, each of us tried out the new and improved Alarm.io with one person.
              Before the testing, we gave them an overview of the application and how the modified
              photo punishment will work. During the test, we called the user in the early morning
              and threaten to upload an embarrassing picture of them on Instagram if they snooze
              their alarm. We used a ticking sound and count down every minute to increase the
              user's anxiety level. To ensure they wake up, we asked for a picture of them brushing
              their teeth. If they fail to send the picture within 5 minutes, we will post a
              photoshopped image of them on Instagram. After the test, we conducted an interview
              with the user to gather feedback on their experience. This helped us determine if the
              modified photo punishment feature is effective and how we can improve it further.

            <h4>Final emotional design</h4>
            <p>
              Our goal was to design an alarm clock app called Alarm.io that uses emotional design
              to help users wake up on time. To use the app, users must sign up and connect with
              Instagram, selecting 5 photos for the app to modify. They also need to connect their
              electric toothbrush via Bluetooth. The app provides a thorough introduction during the
              sign-up process. <br />
              <br />
              To wake up on time, users must set the alarm for their desired wake-up time. When the
              alarm goes off, a triggering sound plays, and if the user doesn't start brushing their
              teeth, the app threatens to post a modified photo of them on Instagram. The app
              provides a preview of the possible photo, and a 5-minute countdown with ticking noises
              starts. If the user starts brushing their teeth within that time, the app
              congratulates them and records their success. <br />
              <br />
              If the user hits snooze, the app gives them one more chance to wake up and brush their
              teeth, threatening to post a modified photo if they fail again. If the user doesn't
              start brushing within a minute, the app posts the modified photo on their Instagram
              account for 24 hours, accompanied by a descriptive text to amplify the anxiety. <br />
              <br />
              Overall, Alarmio uses emotional design to motivate users to wake up on time and form
              healthy habits, using gamification and social media pressure to encourage success.

            <h4>Video explaining Alarm.io</h4>
            <p>
              As part of the Design for Emotion course, my group created a 3-minute video explaining
              our project on Alarm.io. After all 19 videos were presented, everyone had the
              opportunity to vote in four categories: 'Best movie', 'Best acting', 'Best concept',
              and 'Overall best'. To our excitement, our video made history by winning in three out
              of the four categories! We're proud to share our award-winning movie with you, which
              you can watch here.
