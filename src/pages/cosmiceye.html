              During my internship, my primary focus was redesigning the CoSMiC-EYE application, a
              satellite-based tool for monitoring critical infrastructure near pipelines. Users,
              including data analysts and clients, use this application to compare satellite images
              and detect changes near pipelines. As a UX/UI designer, I conducted extensive
              research, created high-fidelity prototypes, and followed a five-phase design process:
              Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. This involved understanding user
              needs, adding features, removing unnecessary elements, and crafting a new interface to
              improve usability and functionality.

            <h4>Empathizing</h4>
            <p>
              My research aimed to understand our customers' needs and enhance CoSMiC-EYE for a
              smoother user experience. I started by delving into CoSMiC-EYE's strengths and
              weaknesses through desk research and expert reviews. This helped me understand our
              company's history and software concerns. I then had in-depth interviews with
              colleagues and long-time customers to uncover ways to improve the app. I even hit the
              field, spending eight hours classifying 48 third-party interferences in the
              Netherlands. This hands-on experience gave me insights into user challenges.

            <h4>Analysing</h4>
            <p>
              In the analysis phase, I examined research findings and observations through methods
              like User stories, Persona, Sitemap, and Workflow. User stories highlighted pain
              points and suggested solutions, defining personas' motivations and goals. During the
              "Define" phase, I streamlined workflows to match user needs, optimizing pages and
              features. I created a sitemap and a feature list for the new app, ensuring organized
              progress.

            <h4>Prototyping</h4>
            <p>
              In the prototyping phase, I started visualizing my ideas by creating low-fidelity
              prototypes for the tablet version since it is the most used, and the space is limited.
              This was followed by testing and according to the results, I started creating
              high-fidelity prototypes. The processes went as follows: Low-fidelity -> Testing ->
              Improving -> High-fidelity -> Testing -> Improving, etc. A comparison of the old and
              new versions of the CoSMiC-EYE application with an explanation of the functionality
              can be found below. I will present a couple pages that underwent the most significant
              changes and describe what I improved and why.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <b>The Listview</b> is a new feature that the customers requested. The user can see
              all the reports according to the chosen date range and filters. They can sort, expand,
              and download the list. Listview helps the users have a clear and quick overview of the
              possible TPIs and assign them to the field operators. Some of the customers used to
              make a list of the TPIs themselves which now is not necessary anymore, saving them a
              lot of time. A new feature called ‘select area’ has also been adapted, which allows
              the user to select their desired area and show the reports of that zone only.
            </p>

          </div>

          <p>
            <b>The Optical page</b> is one of the most important features for our customers. They
            can compare images of different dates to notice changes in the location and predict
            possible interferences. By dragging either the purple or green handle, they can change
            the dates, upper or lower the brightness, and use the slider between two images for
            comparison. Previously, the report page had an upper navigation bar, and even though it
            was deactivated, it still confused the users. The date range selection did not make the
            users recall immediately which handle responses to which photo and the dates in the
            corners were not very visible. Now the hierarchy of the tabs has been changed, the date
            range is below the images, the user can see how many photos are available, the colors of
            the dates correlate with the handles, and the users can expand and collapse the dates to
            gain more image space.

            <h4>Testing</h4>
            <p>
              One of my favorite phases in the design process was testing. I will present a few of
              the more interesting findings of an important feature in the app - date range. The
              user is prompted to enter a date range as soon as they enter the web app to display
              TPIs based on a chosen date range. Firstly, due to the user's request for a list view,
              we tried to combine it with the date range, but after testing, the list view emerged
              as its own feature. Then after testing, we decided to cut out all but the most
              essential functions from the sidebar and move the calendar above the map to indicate
              that they belong together. Initially, the calendar was collapsed and the user had to
              tap on the start date to choose, but we ended up eliminating this unnecessary step and
              now the calendar opens automatically. The issue of adding 'save' and 'cancel' buttons
              to the previous workflow was also discussed, but testing revealed that the current
              flow is intuitive enough without them. Last but not least, the testing divulged that
              start and end dates must be distinguished by distinctive colors that are also
              consistent with optical images.

            <h4>&#11088; 2nd-year 1st-semester highlights</h4>
            <p>
              My 2nd-year 1st semester had some cool moments. First off, I started an internship at
              Orbital Eye. It was awesome to work with a fantastic team on a challenging project
              that pushed me out of my comfort zone. I got to learn a bunch of new stuff I'd never
              touched before. + I saw so many baby goats. &#128584
 We also had this company trip to Lille, and it was a blast. We
              explored the city, played card games, did a murder mystery thing, and the best part?
              Indoor skydiving – and yes, I rocked a Spiderman costume while doing it. That was the
              cherry on top. <br />Then there was that classic Dutch experience when I lost my bike
              at Delft station. Spent a good hour trying to track it down. Taught me to always take
              a photo of my parking slot. &#128516 On top of all that, I improved my 3D animation
              skills and created some cool 3D paintings. Oh, and I can't forget that I snagged my
              first-year propaedeutic diploma with distinction.
