              NS, the Dutch railway company, approached my team of 3 for a solution to create better
              bicycle parking at smaller stations. They wanted an innovative, user-friendly design
              that solves space issues and safety concerns. This design needed to be easily
              installable at any small Dutch station, adaptable to various bike types, and provide
              guaranteed, secure parking. Our focus was on the entire user journey, including bike
              and train travel, and exploring additional NS services. Ultimately, our goal was an
              affordable, sustainable solution that ensures commuter satisfaction and bicycle
              safety.

            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>
              People in the Netherlands have the option to subscribe to a locker service provided by
              NS, which allows them to store their bikes safely at train stations. Currently, the
              design challenge is centered around the redesign of the existing bicycle lockers at
              small train stations in the country. The primary objective is to address the problem
              of long waiting lists, which can stretch for months. By studying the travel patterns
              and preferences of users, we can develop effective and innovative solutions to tackle
              this issue and enhance the user experience. By prioritizing efficiency, security, and
              reliability for the user, we can elegantly solve this problem.

            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Convenient bike storage</b> <br />While commuting by train, cyclists require a
                secure and convenient location to park their bikes. The revamped lockers and
                enhanced bike parking options aim to fulfill this requirement by providing a
                seamless and easily accessible area for storing bikes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Time efficiency</b> <br />Commuters require a hassle-free way to park their bikes
                and hop onto the train quickly, without waiting for extended periods or walking long
                distances to reach the platform. By upgrading the lockers and bike parking
                facilities, NS aims to enhance this experience by making the process of storing
                bikes and the flow of getting to the train more smooth and efficient.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Cost-effectiveness</b><br />
                Commuters are always looking for affordable transportation options. NS can attract
                more cost-conscious commuters by providing bike parking facilities that are less
                expensive than driving and parking a car at the train station.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Comfort</b> <br />People who travel to work like to feel relaxed during their
                journey. Making it easier for bike riders to access the locker, and get to the train
                can make their trip more fun and relaxed. This may get more people to use the train
                and increase the number of passengers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Safety and Security </b><br />People who travel to work on bikes should not have
                to worry about the condition of their bikes and should feel relaxed. They must have
                complete trust in the place 2 where they keep their bike. This also includes
                minimizing the potential of loss or malfunctions in the system

            <h4>Research aim</h4>
            <p>
              The goal of our project is to better understand how people use the current bike
              lockers and other parking facilities for their bikes. We aim to see how bike commuters
              interact with these spaces so we can come up with design solutions that work best for
              them. By observing how users behave at the facilities and conducting other research
              methods, we can derive insights for potential solutions that meet the user's needs and
              render bike parking more UX-friendly.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              To tackle our research questions, we employed a range of methods, including desk
              research, observation, interviews, user journey mapping, collages, service blueprints,
              and competitor analysis.

            <h4>Research insights</h4>
            <p>
              <b
                >Insight 1: The rental process for lockers is lengthy and lacks locker availability
                information.</b
              ><br />
              <i
                >The current locker rental process lacks transparency and can be frustrating for
                users due to a lengthy form, unclear locker availability, and uncertain
                communication. NS should enhance this process for a better user experience.</i
              ><br /><br />
              <b
                >Insight 2: Commuters are more likely to rent a locker for their bicycles due to
                negative experiences with unguarded bike racks.</b
              >
              <br /><i
                >During interviews with locker users, we found that many rented lockers due to past
                bike theft or vandalism experiences, seeking security for their belongings.
                Conversely, most non-locker users reported no such issues, even with expensive bikes
                at stations. This suggests a "survivor bias" â€“ locker users believe it's worth it
                because they avoid theft, while non-locker users think the same for not renting.</i
              ><br /><br />
              <b
                >Insight 3: The perceptions of convenience, efficiency, and safety associated with
                parking options vary between users of lockers and bike racks.</b
              >
              <br /><i
                >During interviews about parking safety and convenience, we observed a disconnect
                between what people claimed and the observed reality. Both groups of commuters
                believed their parking method was the quickest and safest, but it was surprising to
                hear this from non-locker users, given instances of bikes being mishandled.
                Efficiency opinions also varied, with locker users claiming it's faster and
                non-locker users stating the opposite. This suggests speed isn't the primary factor
                when considering locker rentals. </i
              ><br /><br />
              <b
                >Insight 4: The lockers are being used inefficiently - there is no flexibility in
                renting the locker.</b
              >
              <br /><i
                >Through observations, we discovered that lockers are mainly used during work or
                school hours, leaving them vacant on weekends and non-workdays. This leads to
                waiting lists while rented lockers sit unused. Some lockers are used sparingly,
                functioning more as storage units, accessed only weekly or monthly.</i
              >
              <br /><br />
              <b
                >Insight 5: During peak hours, the cluttered and visually unappealing bike parking
                area leads travelers to leave their bikes outside the designated parking area.</b
              >
              <br /><i
                >During the observation, we noticed the repeating pattern of random bike parking
                around the dedicated area. Bikes are usually parked closer to the station during the
                rush hours in the morning. Random bike parking is associated with a lack of
                available racks closer to the station.

            <h4>How our approach differs from traditional lockers?</h4>
            <p>
              What made our design truly unique was our commitment to fostering a sense of community
              and trust. We aspired to create a warm and inviting shared space that welcomed
              everyone, regardless of whether they possessed an OV chip card. Our inclusive approach
              allowed us to forge meaningful connections between users and NS while fostering a
              strong sense of camaraderie among the users themselves. By embracing this inclusive
              mindset, we were able to further amplify the confidence and trust that users had in
              NS, ensuring that every individual felt secure and supported within our parking
              facility.<br /><br />
              Integrating fun into our concepts was an exciting part of our design journey. When we
              presented our ideas to NS, they seemed genuinely enthusiastic about our more creative
              concepts. While practicality remained important, they encouraged us to maintain a
              sense of enjoyment and imagination in the final design. We understood the importance
              of striking the right balance, ensuring that the fun element was subtle, easily
              accessible, and brought immense joy to users. It didn't require a significant time
              commitment and was optional. This fun aspect aimed to provide users with a compelling
              reason to return regularly. Even if they had extra time before their train departure,
              they could engage with this delightful feature, adding a touch of joy to their day.
